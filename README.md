🧬 What is OCG?

On-Chain Trust Graph (OCG) is a cryptographic identity layer for Web3.

It allows wallets to prove:

“I am still the same human.”

…even when devices, keys, or wallets change.

OCG turns:
	•	Contribution NFTs
	•	DAO approvals
	•	On-chain history

into a graph of cryptographic trust.

⸻

🔗 Core Idea

Traditional Web3 identity:

wallet = human

OCG changes it to:

human = cryptographic continuity across wallets

🧠 What It Does

Capability	Description
Trust score	How credible a wallet is
Sybil detection	Whether a wallet is likely a bot or farm
Continuity proof	Whether two wallets belong to the same human
Contribution identity	NFTs define reputation
Migration safety	Reputation survives wallet changes


⸻

🔌 Integrations

OCG is designed to integrate with:
	•	Seedless Wallets → move reputation to new smart wallets
	•	TxGuard → block risky or bot-like senders
	•	VEC → allow execution only if the same human
	•	DAOs → Sybil-resistant airdrops & voting

🧠 Why This Matters

Web3 today suffers from:
	•	Bots
	•	Sybil farms
	•	Fake wallets
	•	Identity loss when keys change

OCG creates:

A cryptographic layer of human continuity

Not KYC.
Not biometrics.
Not centralized.

Just math, signatures, and reputation.

Builder at the intersection of AI × Web3 × Cryptographic Trust

Building systems where humans can prove they are real — without revealing who they are.

⚠️ Final Reminder

This is a testnet-only experimental protocol.
	•	Do NOT use with real money
	•	Do NOT assume safety
	•	Do NOT deploy on mainnet

This is research infrastructure.

# 🔐 SECURITY — On-Chain Trust Graph (OCG)

Last Updated: 2026

---

## ⚠️ Testnet & Research Only

OCG is **not production software**.

There are expected vulnerabilities, incomplete logic, and unprotected attack surfaces.

If you find a bug, exploit, or security weakness, **DO NOT** publish it publicly before contacting us.

---

## 🧠 Threat Model

OCG is designed to experiment with:
- cryptographic identity continuity
- reputation graphs
- Sybil resistance

It is **not designed to**:
- secure funds
- protect wallets
- guarantee identity
- stop attackers

Breaking it is easy. That is expected.

---

## 🐛 Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not exploit it on mainnet**
2. **Do not post it on Twitter, Discord, or GitHub issues**
3. **Do not use it to steal or impersonate users**

Instead:

📩 Contact the maintainer privately  
via the contact listed in the repository profile.

Provide:
- what you found
- how it works
- how it can be abused
- proof-of-concept if available

You will receive acknowledgment.

## 🚫 No Bug Bounty

This is a research system.

There is:
- no bounty
- no reward
- no payment
- no token
- no legal claim

However, contributors who act in good faith may be publicly credited if they wish.

---

## 🔓 Known Classes of Vulnerabilities

The following are expected:
- Sybil attacks
- Score manipulation
- Replay attacks (in test versions)
- Indexer poisoning
- Graph gaming
- Fake continuity claims

Do not assume safety.

---

## 🛑 Abuse

Using OCG to:
- impersonate real people
- deceive DAOs
- fake identity
- bypass KYC
- manipulate airdrops

is unethical and against the intent of this project.

We will not assist with abuse.

---

## 🧬 Philosophy

OCG is about:
**cryptographic reputation, not real-world identity.**

It is meant to explore:
How humans can persist across wallets without revealing who they are.

Everything else is out of scope.

---

**This system is for builders, not attackers.**

🧠 OnChain Trust Graph (OCG)

Proof of Human Continuity for Web3

We do not make Sybil impossible.
We make it uneconomical, unstable, and visible.

We do not guarantee identity.
We compute confidence in human continuity.

⸻

Finance 2.0 is growing fast — but fundamental human problems remain unresolved:
• Sybil wallets can influence DAOs and governance
• Reputation disappears when wallets change
• Keys are remembered, humans are not

OCG offers a different primitive.

OCG is a cryptographic identity and reputation layer that allows a human to remain continuous — even when their wallets are not.
• No KYC
• No biometrics
• No centralized identity

Just signatures, math, time, and on-chain history.
No oracles. No authorities.

⸻

🔗 From wallets to humans

Today, Finance 2.0 assumes:

wallet = human

OCG upgrades this assumption to:

human = cryptographic continuity across wallets

If you:
• Lose your keys
• Upgrade to a smart account
• Migrate devices
• Or suffer a compromise

Your reputation does not vanish.
It moves with you — provably.

Wallets become containers.
Humans become the persistent entity.

Continuity is always opt-in:
a new wallet can only inherit history through explicit cryptographic consent (signatures or defined recovery).
No system can silently bind wallets together.

⸻

🧬 Reputation becomes portable

OCG transforms:
• Contribution NFTs
• DAO roles and approvals
• On-chain behavior and history

into a living trust graph.

This graph reflects:
• Who contributed value
• Who behaved consistently
• Who earned trust over time

And where trust weakened or broke — based purely on observable behavior.

No opinions.
No centralized judgment.
Only cryptographic evidence and time.

⸻

🛡️ Built for a hostile internet

OCG assumes adversaries exist.

The system is designed to make fake identities expensive and real human continuity powerful through:
• Sybil resistance via funding and cluster analysis
• Trust decay over time without consistent behavior
• Signature-based wallet-to-wallet continuity (EIP-712)
• Contribution-weighted reputation signals

Trust is not granted.
It is earned, preserved, or lost — transparently.

Importantly, the graph produces evidence, not verdicts.
OCG never decides who someone is — it only exposes what cryptographic history exists.

⸻

🔌 Plug in, don’t replace

OCG does not compete with your stack.
It strengthens it.

Designed to integrate with:
• Seedless wallets
• Account abstraction (ERC-4337)
• DAOs and governance systems
• Airdrops and contribution rewards
• Voting mechanisms
• Transaction security layers (e.g. TxGuard)

Anywhere identity, trust, or reputation matters.

⸻

🌍 Why this is inevitable

Finance 2.0 cannot reach its full potential without trust.

But trust cannot come from:
• Governments
• Corporations
• Centralized registries

Trust emerges from:
• Behavior
• Cryptography
• Time

OCG is that missing layer.

Not identity as surveillance —
but identity as continuity.

⸻

🚫 Non-Goals (Explicit Boundaries)

OCG is not:
• A global identity system
• A KYC replacement
• A social credit score
• A surveillance or behavioral control mechanism

OCG does not aim to define who you are —
only to preserve what you have done, cryptographically.

The right to start over is fundamental:
forgetting is always allowed, and continuity is never forced.

⸻

🧪 Experimental Status

OCG is:
• Experimental
• Evolving
• Not audited
• Not production-safe

Built in public.
Improved through scrutiny.

This is research infrastructure — not a finished product.

⸻

🧭 Final Note

Blockchains already remember transactions forever.
OCG asks a different question:

What if they could remember humans — without owning them?

That is the problem this project explores.

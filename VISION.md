🧠 On-Chain Trust Graph (OCG)
Proof of Human Continuity for Web3
Web3 is growing fast — but fundamental human problems remain unresolved.
* Sybil wallets can influence DAOs and governance
* Reputation disappears when wallets change
* Keys are remembered, humans are not
OCG offers a different primitive.
OCG is a cryptographic identity and reputation layer that allows a human to remain continuous — even when their wallets are not.
* No KYC
* No biometrics
* No centralized identity
Just signatures, math, time, and on-chain history. No oracles. No authorities.

🔗 From wallets to humans
Today, Web3 assumes:
wallet = human
OCG upgrades this assumption to:
human = cryptographic continuity across wallets
If you:
* Lose your keys
* Upgrade to a smart account
* Migrate devices
* Or suffer a compromise
Your reputation does not vanish. It moves with you — provably.
Wallets become containers. Humans become the persistent entity.

🧬 Reputation becomes portable
OCG transforms:
* Contribution NFTs
* DAO roles and approvals
* On-chain behavior and history
into a living trust graph.
This graph reflects:
* Who contributed value
* Who behaved consistently
* Who earned trust over time
And where trust weakened or broke — based purely on observable behavior.
No opinions. No centralized judgment. Only cryptographic evidence and time.

🛡️ Built for a hostile internet
OCG assumes adversaries exist.
The system is designed to make fake identities expensive and real human continuity powerful through:
* Sybil resistance via funding and cluster analysis
* Trust decay over time without consistent behavior
* Signature-based wallet-to-wallet continuity (EIP-712)
* Contribution-weighted reputation signals
Trust is not granted. It is earned, preserved, or lost — transparently.

🔌 Plug in, don’t replace
OCG does not compete with your stack. It strengthens it.
Designed to integrate with:
* Seedless wallets
* Account abstraction (ERC-4337)
* DAOs and governance systems
* Airdrops and contribution rewards
* Voting mechanisms
* Transaction security layers (e.g. TxGuard)
Anywhere identity, trust, or reputation matters.

🌍 Why this is inevitable
Web3 cannot reach its full potential without trust.
But trust cannot come from:
* Governments
* Corporations
* Centralized registries
Trust emerges from:
* Behavior
* Cryptography
* Time
OCG is that missing layer.
Not identity as surveillance — but identity as continuity.

🚫 Non-Goals (Explicit Boundaries)
OCG is not:
* A global identity system
* A KYC replacement
* A social credit score
* A surveillance or behavioral control mechanism
OCG does not aim to define who you are — only to preserve what you have done, cryptographically.

🧪 Experimental Status
OCG is:
* Experimental
* Evolving
* Not audited
* Not production-safe
Built in public. Improved through scrutiny.
This is research infrastructure — not a finished product.

🧭 Final Note
Blockchains already remember transactions forever. OCG asks a different question:
What if they could remember humans — without owning them?
That is the problem this project explores.

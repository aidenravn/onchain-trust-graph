🧠 On-Chain Trust Graph

Proof of Human Continuity for Web3

Web3 today is broken.

Bots farm airdrops.
Sybil wallets control DAOs.
Reputation disappears when keys change.

OCG fixes this.

OCG is a cryptographic layer that lets a human stay the same —
even when their wallets don’t.

No KYC.
No biometrics.
No centralized identity.

Just signatures, math, and on-chain history.

🔗 From wallets to humans

Today Web3 thinks:

wallet = human

OCG upgrades it to:

human = cryptographic continuity across wallets

If you lose your keys,
if you upgrade to a smart wallet,
if you get hacked —

your reputation doesn’t die.

It moves with you.

🧬 Reputation becomes portable

OCG turns:
	•	Contribution NFTs
	•	DAO approvals
	•	On-chain history

into a living trust graph.

A graph that knows:
	•	who contributed
	•	who behaved honestly
	•	who stayed consistent over time

And who didn’t.

⸻

🛡️ Built for a hostile internet

OCG assumes attackers exist.

So it uses:
	•	Sybil detection
	•	trust decay
	•	funding analysis
	•	signature-based continuity

to make fake identities expensive and real humans powerful.

⸻

🔌 Plug-in, don’t replace

OCG doesn’t fight your stack.
It upgrades it.

Use it with:
	•	Seedless wallets
	•	Account abstraction
	•	DAOs
	•	Airdrops
	•	Voting
	•	TxGuard

Anywhere identity matters.

⸻

🌍 Why this is inevitable

Web3 cannot scale without trust.
But trust cannot come from governments or companies.

It must come from:
	•	behavior
	•	cryptography
	•	time

OCG is that layer.

⸻

🧪 Experimental. Dangerous. Necessary.

OCG is not safe.
OCG is not finished.
OCG is not audited.

OCG is the missing primitive Web3 needs.

🧠 On-Chain Trust Graph
Proof of Human Continuity for Web3

Web3 is growing fast, but some challenges still exist.
	•	Sybil wallets can influence DAOs.
	•	Reputation can disappear when wallets change.

OCG offers a solution.

OCG is a cryptographic layer that lets a human remain the same even if their wallets don’t.
	•	No KYC
	•	No biometrics
	•	No centralized identity

Just signatures, math, and on-chain history.

🔗 From wallets to humans

Today Web3 thinks:
wallet = human

OCG upgrades this to:
human = cryptographic continuity across wallets
	•	If you lose your keys,
	•	Upgrade to a smart wallet,
	•	Or get hacked —
your reputation doesn’t vanish.
It moves with you.

🧬 Reputation becomes portable

OCG turns:
	•	Contribution NFTs
	•	DAO approvals
	•	On-chain history

into a living trust graph.

This graph knows:
	•	Who contributed
	•	Who behaved honestly
	•	Who stayed consistent over time

And who didn’t.

⸻

🛡️ Built for a challenging internet

OCG assumes attackers exist and uses:
	•	Sybil detection
	•	Trust decay
	•	Funding analysis
	•	Signature-based continuity

to make fake identities costly and real humans powerful.

⸻

🔌 Plug in, don’t replace

OCG doesn’t fight your stack — it strengthens it.
Works with:
	•	Seedless wallets
	•	Account abstraction
	•	DAOs
	•	Airdrops
	•	Voting
	•	TxGuard

Anywhere identity matters.

🌍 Why this is inevitable

Web3 cannot reach its full potential without trust.
But trust doesn’t come from governments or companies.

It comes from:
	•	Behavior
	•	Cryptography
	•	Time

OCG is that layer.

⸻

🧪 Experimental. Innovative. Necessary.
	•	OCG is not fully safe.
	•	OCG is still evolving.
	•	OCG is not audited.

But OCG is the missing primitive Web3 needs.
